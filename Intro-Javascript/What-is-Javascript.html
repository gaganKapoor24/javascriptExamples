        <h2>What is Javascript</h2>
        <p>Javascript is the most popular client-side scripting language. Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run within your web browser. Javascript is designed to add interactivity and dynamic effects to the web pages.<br><br>
        It was originally developed as LiveScript by Netscape in the mid 1990s. It was later renamed to JavaScript in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.<br><br>
        It is an object-oriented language, and it also has some similarities in syntax to Java programming language. But, JavaScript is not related to Java in any way.<br><br>
        It is officially maintained by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) as ECMAScript. ECMAScript 6 (or ES6) is the latest major version of the ECMAScript standard.</p>
